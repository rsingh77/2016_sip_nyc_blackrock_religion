				<p class="aaa"> Santana Dharma, popularly known as Hinduism, is the oldest surviving religion in the world. It is believed the divine revelations to ancient Rishis (sages and seers) resulted in the composition of the Vedas. The combined effort of all these sages collectively became the religion called Santana Dharma (basically means “Eternal Righteous Moral Order”). Unlike other religions, Hinduism did not begin at a certain point in time and has no one particular founder.
</p>
				<ul class="font">
					<li>The Vedas are God’s words and the foundation of Santana Dharma</li>
					<li>There is one all pervasive Brahman (God), who transcends space and time and manifests in many forms.</li>
					<li>The Universe undergoes an endless cycle of creation, preservation, and dissolution. </li>
					<li>Creation came out of the Creator and is part of the Divine</li>
					<li>Under the laws of Karma, each individual creates his own destiny by their thoughts, words, and actions. </li>
					<li>The soul reincarnates, evolving as it goes through many births and deaths, until all karmas are resolved, and moksha (liberation) is attained.</li>
					<li>Through temple worship, rituals and personal devotion, Hindus create special personal relationship with a particular Deity of their choice. </li>

	,"Birla Mandir generally refers to all the different Hindu temples built by the Birla family (in different cities). The Birla temple in Delhi was intended to fill a void. Delhi, even though it was the capital of India, did not have any notable temples at the time. During the Mughal period, temples with shikharas were prohibited until the late Mughal period. The Delhi temple, located at a prominent spot was designed to be lofty and spacious, suitable for congregational worship or discourses. "

Repetitive chanting of OM in accordance with the Vedic methods, generates mystic powers that leads one to concentrate, meditate, and finally get into a state of higher consciousness. The primordial sound OM is produced by combining the sounds of the letters A, U, and M. OM is also called the four element syllable, where the letters A,U,M are three elements, and the silence that follows the chanting to be the fourth element. The sound produced by the letter A represents the wakeful state, the letter U, the dream state, and M, the deep sleep state. Thus, OM represents the complete experiences of all the worlds, and the cosmic Brahman (ultimate reality).

                  <div class="answer" class="panel-body">A temple is the home of God where devotees and the Divine commune. The vibration from the mantras (hymns) that are chanted, the prayers, and other rituals performed in the main hall all result in an environment that is vibrant with divine energy. As such, learned scholars advise devotees to look and feel their best when going to a temple so that they can experience the maximum benefit. It is best to bathe before and wear nice, modest, and clean clothing which would be suitable for sitting on the floor of the temple or prostrating in front of deities.  It is common to see devotees washing their hands or feet before entering the temple, and shoes/slippers must be left outside at designated places. Inside the temple, a lot of devotees may bring fruit, flowers, milk, and other food items. While inside, it is important to maintain an atmosphere of silence, and only speak in soft tones when necessary. In essence, the temple environment gives devotees an opportunity to concentrate and perhaps even experience the Divine with Bhakti (devotion).</div>

                  <div class="answer" class="panel-body">The Varna system, or the caste system, is addressed as a positive factor in the Scriptures. The Varna system encourages division of labor within the society for efficient functioning, based on the natural tendencies of a person. In the Scriptures (the Bhagavad Gita) one’s Varna is determined by one’s own qualities, and not based on one’s birth into a family. Also, it should be addressed that the varna system as it is in the scriptures is a linear (not hierarchical) system. At the basic level, the 4 different Varna’s are Brahmin (thinkers who lead followers on a righteous path), Kshatriya (leaders or warriors), Vaishya (business and finance oriented people), and Sudras (unskilled workers). Most Hindus are strongly encouraged to educate and fight against the caste system as it is practiced today.

Hence, Hindus bow down to the light which represents Knowledge and which is deemed to be the greatest of all forms of wealth. The traditional lamp has further significance. The oil represents desires, and the wick represents ego. When lit by spiritual knowledge, the desires (oil) gets slowly exhausted and ultimately even the wick (ego) burns out. The flame of the lamp is always burning upward, further symbolizing that one should always seeks higher ideals.

They observe the fast by not eating at all, eating less, eating fruits, or just simple food (it varys from person to person and depends on the occasion of the fasting). Fasting is also called Upavaasa, with the word Upa meaning “being near” and Vaasa meaning “to stay.” Through the fasting process, Hindus stay near the Lord and contemplate on him instead of spending time on elaborate preparations of food. Fasting also helps to cultivate the ability to have self control, to have control over one’s senses, and to guide the mind to be peaceful. Obviously, it is unwise (and not recommended) to fast to the extent that one becomes weak or irritable.

Hindus believe that they impact their own future in this and future births through their actions and choices they make through free will. Accordingly, they will get to enjoy the positive results of their virtuous actions and the negative results of their negative actions until all their karmas are resolved so that they can attain moksha (salvation or freeing from the cycle of birth and death).

                  <div class="answer" class="panel-body">The custom of not stepping on educational tools is a frequent reminder of the high position of Knowledge in Hindu culture. This is the reason why books are worshipped (along with other objects, such as musical instruments) during Saraswati poojas. As to touching other people with one’s feet, in the Hindu view, all human beings have divinity (Atma) in them and are therefore living and breathing temples of the Lord. Therefore, touching others with the feet is similar to disrespecting the Atma within that person.

Hindu scriptures do mention seers who ate meat, but it is more common to see it mentioning the virtues of a meat free diet. As such, vegetarianism has been a principle of health and environmental ethics for Hindus. In addition,
