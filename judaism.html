			<p class="aaa"> Judaism originated in the Middle East nearly 4,000 years ago. Judaism is founded on the covenant God made with Abraham and the Jewish people.
            Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, commonly known as the Patriarchs, are the ancestors of Judaism. The three main branches of Judaism are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.
            Today, roughly 14 million people practice Judaism.</p>
			</ol>
				<ul class="font">
					<li>Of the 14 million Jews in the world, 5.5 million live in Israel, around 6 million in the US and about half a million each in the UK, France, South America and the former Soviet Union.</li>
					<li>Jews are not a race, they often describe themselves as a 'people', with an identity which includes elements such as religion, culture, language and historical memory.</li>
					<li>The Hebrew Bible can be described as a library of inspired literature. It was written over a period of nearly a thousand years.</li>
					<li>Jews believe in a single, omniscient, all-powerful God.  God's name in Hebrew is YHWH which means “I am”.</li>
					<li>Anyone that is born of a Jewish mother or converted to Judaism in accord with Jewish Law can be categorized as a Jew.</li>
					<li>In accordance with the Jewish law, Jews recite prayers three times daily, with a fourth prayer added on Shabbat and holidays. Observant traditional Jews recite prayers throughout the day while performing various acts.</li>
					<li>The most practiced Jewish denominations today are Orthodox, Reform, Conservative, Hasidism, and Kabbalah.</li>
					<li>Hanukkah is an eight day Jewish holiday starting on the 25th day of the Hebrew calendar.</li>
