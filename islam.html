The mosque includes extensive colored glass in its facade, and displays other traditional elements such as the Panj Kāse (five concaved) design. It is named in popular culture as the Pink Mosque, due to the usage of considerable pink color tiles for its interior design."
	,"Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is located in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and is considered to be the key site for worship in the country. The project was begun by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, with the purpose of creating a structure that would unite the cultural diversity, along with traditional and modern architecture. Construction of the largest mosque in the UAE began in 1996 to 2007."
	,"The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest, oldest and holiest mosques in the world. The tomb of Saladin stands in a small garden adjoining the north wall of the mosque. In addition, the mosque holds a shrine which is said to contain the head of John the Baptist, who is honored as a prophet by both Christians and Muslims."
	,"The Shrine of Hazrat Ali, also known as the Blue Mosque, is located in Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan. Sunni Muslims believe that this is site of the tomb of Ali ibn Abi Talib (the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad). However, Shia Muslims believe that the real grave of Ali is found within the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf, Iraq (next slide)."
	,"The Imām 'Alī Holy Shrine, also known as Masjid Ali,  in Najaf, Iraq, is considered the third holiest site Shia Muslims. Ali ibn Abi Talib, first Imam according to Shia belief, and the fourth caliph, according to Sunni belief is buried here."
	,"The famous historical Cordoba Mosque in Spain is regarded as one of the most accomplished monuments of Moorish architecture. Originally, it was a small temple of Christian Visigoth origin, a Catholic Basilica of Saint Vincent. When Muslims conquered Spain in 711, the church was divided into Muslim and Christian halves. This sharing arrangement of the site lasted until 784, when the Christian half was purchased by the Emir Abd al Rahman I, who then proceeded to demolish the original structure and build the grand mosque of Córdoba on its ground."
    ,"The Jameh Mosque is the grand, congregational mosque in Ishafan city, Iran. First being built in 771, Jameh Mosque is one of the oldest standing mosques in Iran. It has also been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2012."
    ,"The Kabah is a building at the center of Islam's most sacred mosque, Al-Masjid al-Haram, in Mecca, al-Hejaz, Saudi Arabia. It is the most sacred Muslim site in the world. It is considered the House of Allah and wherever they are in the world, Muslims are expected to face the Kabah when performing salat (prayer)."
    ,"This is the entry gate to the grave of Imam Husayn. The shrine is a holy place for Shia Muslims, as it is the mosque and burial site of  Imam Hussain ibn Ali, the third Imam of Shia Islam, in the city of Karbala, Iraq. Every year, millions of pilgrims visit the city to observe Ashura, which marks the anniversary of Imam Husayn ibn Ali's death."

                  <div class="answer" class="panel-body">The primary sources of knowledge in Islam are the Qur’an, which Muslims generally believe is the divinely revealed word of God, and the Sunnah, which refers to the precedents of the Prophet Muhammad (meaning: what he said, did, approved, disapproved, allowed, etc.) Much of the Sunnah is from the collection of sayings or reports known as hadith, or prophetic tradition. The hadith describe actions of the Prophet Muhammad or actions that his companions attributed to his teachings. Hadith also elaborate and provide context to the Quran. For Shia Muslims, the rulings of the twelve Imams are also considered a primary source, in addition to the Quran and Sunnah.

                  <div class="answer" class="panel-body"> The majority of Sunnis and Shias share the same core beliefs of Islam—the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad—and adhere to the Five Pillars. The main differences between them today are their sources of knowledge and religious leadership. In addition to the Qur’an and hadith, the Shias and the many sects that comprise them rely on the rulings of their Imams and resulting variations in beliefs and practices. The difference originated from the question of succession after the death of the Prophet Muhammad, and is related to differing views about appropriate leadership for the Muslim community. Shias believe that succession lies only with the family and certain descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, while Sunnis believe that the Muslim community was free to choose the most qualified person as ruler.

                  <div class="answer" class="panel-body"> The better term for veil, as some people say, is actually called a hijab. The Arabic word hijab literally means curtain. When used to refer to dress, it usually refers to a headscarf. Hijab is often wrongly used interchangeably with the terms burqa and niqab. Hijab is generally used to refer to a headscarf, Burqa to a covering of the entire body including the face, while Niqab refers to a face covering that conceals most of the face but exposes the eyes. Some Muslim women wear hijab while others do not and expressions of hijab vary greatly by culture, individual taste, and conviction. The answer to this question depends on whom you’re talking to. The wearing of hijab is a matter of free choice by women in most of the Muslim world. Women who choose to wear it do so for a variety of reasons: as a sign of identity, as an act of devotion to their faith, or to indicate that they do not want to be judged by their physical characteristics.

The fast is intended to bring the faithful closer to God and to remind them of the suffering of those less fortunate. Muslims often donate to charities during the month and feed the hungry. Fasting is also an exercise in self-restraint, as it is a way to physically and spiritually detoxify. Ramadan is a time to detach from worldly pleasures and focus inward on one’s prayers. Many Muslims dress more conservatively during Ramadan and spend more time at the mosque than at any other time of the year.
