    <p class="parag2"> We hope you have enjoyed learning more about religion. We created this site to challenge the way religion is taught in schools.
    Often times, religious education innacurately portrays beliefs and customs. A lot of the "facts" we were taught in school were actually the product of misconceptions and stereotypes about other religions.</p>
    <p class="parag2">    With this website, we offer the opportunity to learn the truth behind common misconceptions.
    We aim to debunk stereotypes and present easily digestible information. Our idea stemmed from our dissatisfaction with the religious education in our schools.

  This portrayal of religions, some of which we practice ourselves, affected us personally and inspired us to create A World of Religions, where anyone who is interested can learn the basics of Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism from accurate sources.</p>
<p class="parag2">We (Reva, Aleena, Genevieve, and Cassandra) thank Girls Who Code for giving us this wonderful opportunity, and we thank you for visiting our website.</p>
