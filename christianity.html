                the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament to save humanity from their sins. The Bible is the central religious book of Christianity; it is a collection of scriptures written by different people at different times. Christianity has more than 2.4 billion  adherents from all around the world.</p>

					        <div class="answer" class="panel-body">Denominations of the Christian faith started around the time of the Protestant Reformation  during the 16th century. This movement was caused by the desire to reform the Roman Catholic Church because people were
                            questioning their practices. During this time 4 major divisions emerged: Lutheran, Reformed, Anabaptist, and Anglican. Over time, these four divisions produced many other denominations. Frequently, denominations only differ in the style of worship to adjust to different preferences.</div>

					        <div class="answer" class="panel-body">Christianity and Judaism are very similar, especially in their form of worship, including a priesthood, concepts of sacred space and sacred time. The main distinction between Christianity and Judaism is the perception of Jesus.
                            Judaism believes Jesus was a good teacher, but he was not Messiah. Christians believe Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies of a coming Messiah.</div>

									<div class="answer" class="panel-body">The final week of Lent is known as “Holy Week.” It begins with Palm  Sunday, remembering Jesus' entry into Jerusalem just before his Passion.
										Holy Thursday recreates the Last Supper in which Jesus fed his disciples on the night before he died and washed their feet. Good Friday was the day that Jesus was crucified to death. Holy Saturday is recreated because of  the time of waiting while the body of Jesus lay in the tomb. Lent ends either with the Great Easter Vigil on Easter Eve, or with the Easter Day service.</div>

									</h4>
								</div>
								<div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
									<div class="answer" class="panel-body">Christians as a whole are divided on the topic of abortion. The bible never explicitly mentioned abortion. The beliefs of Christians range from extremely pro-life to extremely pro-choice. Although there is no general agreement on the topic, most Christians would agree to avoid having an abortion if satisfactory alternatives are available.
										Numerous churches, like United Church of Christ, Episcopal, Presbyterian and United Methodist, support a woman's choice to have abortion if she believes it is the best choice. A survey conducted by LifeWay, a Christian research group, showed that 70% of the 1,038 women they interviewed who has abortions were Christian.</div>

									<div class="answer" class="panel-body">The Orthodox Church does not have a single spiritual leader like the Pope is to the Catholic church. It is organized into “jurisdictions” following national and historic lines, based on the early Church model of conciliar church leadership seen in the Book of Acts.
										Each group is governed by synods, which are councils of bishops. Synods have equal authority and do not interfere in one another’s affairs. The Patriarch of Constantinople is known as the “Ecumenical” Patriarch.
										Since the division of the Roman Catholic Church from the Eastern churches, he has enjoyed a position of honor among the Orthodox communities. </div>
