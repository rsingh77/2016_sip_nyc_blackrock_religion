            <p class="aaa">Buddhism is a religion based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, or the 'Buddha'. Buddha attained enlightenment and assumed the title Lord Buddha.
							It teaches numerous beliefs, and practices regarding self-realization and attuning to the will of the universe. Buddhism is practiced by approximately 300 million people today.
							 Buddhism is practiced mostly in China, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Taiwan, Cambodia, Japan and India.</p>
				<ul class="font">
					<li>Buddhism is founded in northeastern India.</li>
					<li>Prince Siddharta Gautama abandoned his family's wealthy lifestyle in search of the true way to end suffering. In his quest, he found that the Middle Way was the path to awareness, enlightenment, and peace.</li>
					<li>Meditation is a key practice in Buddhism to understand the mind in order to achieve enlightenment.</li>
					<li>Chanting is a common practice in Buddhist communities.</li>
					<li>Originating in India, where writing was rare, chanting enabled important texts to be passed from person to person.</li>
					<li>The ritual of chanting was eventually found to be a useful way to focus the mind, and remember and internalize key Buddhist ideas.</li>
					<li>Three types of structures are associated with the religious architecture of early Buddhism: monasteries (viharas), places to venerate relics (stupas), and shrines or prayer halls.</li>
					<li>The goal of Buddhism is to reach Nirvana, which means cessation of passion, aggression and ignorance.</li>
					<li>The basic doctrines of early Buddhism is the “four noble truths”.</li>
					<li>Buddhism is divided into two main schools, the Theravada and the Mahayana. The Vajrayana is another school predominant in Tibet and Japan.</li>

										 The first monks and nuns were taught to make their clothes of “pure” cloth, which meant unwanted cloth, so the cloth was often filthy. Today, priests and nuns create robes from cloth that is donated or purchased.
										 The robe consists of 3 layers, a waistcloth (antaravasaka), an upper robe (uttarasanga) and outer robe (sanghati).</div>

                  of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion.” During the time of the Buddha, India was covered in forests. He mentioned the “'foot of a tree” as the basic shelter for bhikkhus. Eventually monasteries were built and many adapted to a more settled lifestyle. Today many monks live in village monasteries. </div>
