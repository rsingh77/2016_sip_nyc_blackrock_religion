            <p class="aaa">Judaism originated in the Middle East nearly 4,000 years ago. Judaism is founded on the covenant God made with Abraham and the Jewish people.
            Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, commonly known as the Patriarchs, are the ancestors of Judaism. The three main branches of Judaism are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.
            Today, roughly 14 million people practice Judaism.</p>
				<ul class="font">
					<li>Similar beliefs to Judaism - coming of Messiah</li>
					<li>Appeal to poor people</li>
					<li>Jesus of Nazareth was born Jewish - he preached in Israel: a moral code of love, charity, and humility</li>
					<li>Put to death in AD 30: he was seen as an agitator to rich people and to the government</li>
					<li>Resurrected on the 3rd day</li>
					<li>This made him known as the Son of God: belief helped spread religion throughout the Roman Empire and in Jewish communities in the Middle East</li>
					<li>By 4th century AD 10% of Roman Empire was a convert</li>
					<li>Slave, dispossessed farmers, and impoverished city dwellers found hope in this religion</li>
					<li>Different denominations include Catholic Christians, Methodists, Presbyterian, Southern Baptists, and Lutheran</li>
					<li>The Ten Commandments are the obligations Christians must fulfill in order to get into heaven and receive eternal life</li>
					<li>Prayer is the act of communicating with God</li>

                  <div class="answer" class="panel-body">In most Buddhist traditions it is common for monks and nuns to shave their head. There is a rule saying Theravada Buddhists, also known as bhikkhu, cannot grow their hair beyond a certain length, so they
										 usually shave their head once a month or sometimes more frequently. Siddhartha Gautama shaved his head before leaving his palace and becoming the Buddha. Therefore many monks perceive the act of shaving their head
										 as embodying their principal spiritual teacher.</div>

										 The first monks and nuns were taught to make their clothes of “pure” cloth, which meant unwanted cloth, so the cloth was often filthy. Today, priests and nuns create robes from cloth that is donated or purchased.
										 The robe consists of 3 layers, a waistcloth (antaravasaka), an upper robe (uttarasanga) and outer robe (sanghati).</div>

                  of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion.” During the time of the Buddha, India was covered in forests. He mentioned the “'foot of a tree” as the basic shelter for bhikkhus. Eventually monasteries were built and many adapted to a more settled lifestyle. Today many monks live in village monasteries. </div>
